# KCA_DataScienceProjects
This Repo is for all Data Science Projects at KCA

# Project 1
## Diabetes Machine Learning

# Project 2
## Student Exam Performance Prediction
  - This project aims to predict student exam performance based on demographic information and study behavior using machine learning techniques.
  - The dataset used is the Student Performance Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
## The project includes 
  - data preprocessing,
  - feature selection,
  - model training, evaluation,
  - visualization of results.
## The models trained include 
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree, 
  
## The trained models are saved for future use, and the project can be found on GitHub for further exploration.
## The project structure includes:
 - Data Preprocessing: Loading, cleaning, and exploring the dataset
 - Feature Selection/Engineering and Data Splitting
 - Model Training: Using Logistic Regression and Decision Tree algorithms
 - Model Evaluation: Using accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix
 
## Expected Further Analysis
  - The project can be extended by
      - exploring additional features,
      - trying different algorithms, or
      - tuning hyperparameters for better performance.
